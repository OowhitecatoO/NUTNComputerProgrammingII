A real-estate developer wants to estimate the cost of each apartment on each floor of his development before he starts marketing them. He has decided to quote different prices for apartments on different floors.
The price for all apartments on the first floor is a sum of their base price, charges on amenities, and taxes.
The apartments from the second floor on will see a 2% increase in their base price.
For example, if an apartment on the first floor has a base price of $650,000, an apartment on the second floor has a base price of $663,000.
Charges on amenities are charged at a specified rate on an apartment's base price.
Taxes are calculated at a specified rate on the sum of an apartment's base price and the charges on amenities.
Your program asks for the number of stories(?), the base price of apartments on the first floor, and the rates (as a decimal) of the charges on amenities, and taxes.
Thr program should output the base price, charges on amenities taxes, and the total price of apartments on each floor.
