# CH2 Pr2
Write a program that finds and prints all of the prime numbers between 3 and 100.
A prime number is a number that can only be divided by one and itself (i.e., 3, 5, 7, 11, 13,17, ...).
One wat to solve this problem is to use a doubly-nested loop.
The outer loop can iterate from 3 to 100, while the inner loop checks to see whether the counter value for the outer loop is prime.
If none of the values from 2 to $n$ - 1 evenly divides $n$, then n must be prime.
(Note that there are several easy ways to make this algorithm more efficient.)
