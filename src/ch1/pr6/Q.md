    A city cab service provider charges customers based on distance and time.
    The service charges $2 for the first two kilometers.
    After the first two kilometers, the service charges $0.50 per kilometer for the next six kilometers.
    After six kilometers, the customer is charged $1 per kilometer.
    At the end of the ride, a fee of $0.2 per minute is charged based on total travel duration.
    Write a program that reads the distance traveled in kilometers and the time taken in minutes for a cab ride and computes the fare based on the service's charges.
