    A person runs on a treadmill for fifteen minutes a day as part of their exercise routine.
    They start the workout at a speed of 4 MPH for the first three minutes,
    and then increase it by 2 MPH after every four minutes.
    Write a program to calcaulate the total calories burned during this workout.
    The number of calories burned may be estimated using the formula
    
    MET: Number of metabolic equivalents
    W: Weight in kilograms
    
    Calories/Minute = 0.0175 * MET * W
    
    Running at 6 MPH expends 10 METS.
    Your program should input the person's weight in kilograms and output the calories burned by them.
